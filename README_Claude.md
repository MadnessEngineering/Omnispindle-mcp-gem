# Omnispindle CLI Bridge - Claude Agent Knowledge Repository

A curated collection of documentation and code examples for integrating Omnispindle MCP todo server capabilities with Claude Agents. This repository serves as a knowledge base to allow Claude to interact with the Omnispindle ecosystem.

## AI Model Integration Docs

- [Claude Agents](./README_Claude.md) (You are here)
- [OpenAI GPTs](./README_GPT.md)
- [Goose AI](./README_Goose.md)
- [Gemini Gems](./README.md)

## Purpose

This project houses the documentation needed to understand and integrate with the Omnispindle ecosystem. It's designed to be used as a knowledge source for Claude Agents, providing:

- Function signatures and interfaces
- Usage examples and patterns
- Project validation logic
- Data structure definitions

## Usage with Claude Agents

To integrate with Claude Agents, provide the contents of this repository as part of your prompt or as uploaded knowledge. This will give the agent the necessary context on:

1.  **Available Functions**: Todo management, lessons learned, MQTT pub/sub
2.  **Project Validation**: Supported projects and naming conventions
3.  **Data Formats**: Expected input/output structures
4.  **Integration Patterns**: How to properly interface with the MCP server
