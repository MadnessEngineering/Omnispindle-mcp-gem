# Omnispindle CLI Bridge - Goose AI Knowledge Repository

A curated collection of documentation and code examples for integrating Omnispindle MCP todo server capabilities with Goose AI. This repository serves as a knowledge base to allow Goose AI to interact with the Omnispindle ecosystem.

## AI Model Integration Docs

- [Claude Agents](./README_Claude.md)
- [OpenAI GPTs](./README_GPT.md)
- [Goose AI](./README_Goose.md) (You are here)
- [Gemini Gems](./README.md)

## Purpose

This project houses the documentation needed to understand and integrate with the Omnispindle ecosystem. It's designed to be used as a knowledge source for Goose AI, providing:

- Function signatures and interfaces
- Usage examples and patterns
- Project validation logic
- Data structure definitions

## Usage with Goose AI

To integrate with Goose AI, provide the contents of this repository as part of your prompt or context. This will give the model the necessary information on:

1.  **Available Functions**: Todo management, lessons learned, MQTT pub/sub
2.  **Project Validation**: Supported projects and naming conventions
3.  **Data Formats**: Expected input/output structures
4.  **Integration Patterns**: How to properly interface with the MCP server
